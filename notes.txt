6 lanes

lane buttons (in order): 
- SNES Controller
    - Dpad_left Dpad_down Dpad_right Y B A
    - (this is Dpad and letter buttons w/out top most button)
- Keyboard
    - s d f j k l
        - basically home-row keys on keyboard

logistical buttons
pause - upper left and upper right (?)
menu options - left+right upper buttons (?)

notes:
[ lane_num(int), y_pos(int), missed(bool) ]
    - lane_num: which lane is the note on (0-5)
    - y_pos: the y coordinate so that note can fall
    - missed: whether or not a note has been missed
        - allows for lane to change color if missed
implementation:
    - at the moment: hard-coded list (terrible ik)
    - future: csv import file song_name.csv

score
- missed (0 points), good (1 point), perfect (3 points)
